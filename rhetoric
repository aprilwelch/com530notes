"Rhetoric, in its better sense, is a productive generative art of communicating with other human beings. THe art of rhetoric enables people to discover, as it is expressed in Aristotle's Rhetoric, the available means for developing something to say, and for supporting what they say. Rhetoric also suggests how to establish the best form to say something in, and to deliver the form appropriately for a particular audience in a particular context of time, values, and beliefs.

Rhetoric is one word for "good content, good design, providing an experience that merits return visits and a masterful use of the technologies that make up the web."
